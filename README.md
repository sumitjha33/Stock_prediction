The Stock Trend Prediction App is a user-friendly web application designed to predict future stock trends based on historical data. Built with a clean and responsive interface, the app allows users to input key stock parameters such as open price, high price, low price, SMA values, volume, and more to generate accurate predictions powered by advanced machine learning algorithms. Developed using Flask and Python for the backend and styled with modern HTML and CSS for an engaging experience, the app ensures smooth navigation and intuitive usage. It leverages libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn for data processing and modeling. This project aims to assist users in making informed financial decisions by providing instant predictions in a visually appealing and interactive way. Future improvements include real-time stock data integration via APIs, chart visualizations of trends, and user authentication for personalized prediction histories.
